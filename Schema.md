Here is how my schema is setup, for those who have thoroughly used the lowest
level of Apple language schema.

Here are some significant changes from Apple's terms to my own, so that
I can read this better when using said code.

Change:
   osport
Original:
   mach_port_t

Change:
   sys_return_t 
Original:
   kern_return_t

Change:
   IO_Call_Invoke

   IOConnectCallMethod
